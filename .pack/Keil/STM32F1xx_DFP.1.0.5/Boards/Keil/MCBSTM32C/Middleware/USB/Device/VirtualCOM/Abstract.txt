This is an Virtual COM example that demonstrates Communication Device Class (CDC)
on USB Device.

It demonstrates a bridge between PC USB Virtual COM Port and UART port on the 
evaluation board and is based on a Windows USB host driver (usbser.sys).

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_cdc_tutorial.html

Board:                  Keil 'MCBSTM32C'
Microcontroller:        ST   'STM32F107'
Clock Settings:         XTAL   = 25 MHz
                        CPUCLK = 72 MHz
                        USBCLK = 48 MHz

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "MCBSTM32C USB VCom Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.

Testing the USB Virtual COM Port with serial cable:

  Open two Hyperterminal windows. 
      One with "MCBSTM32C USB VCOM Port(COMx)" 
      One with "Communications Port (COM1)"
  Connect PC port COM1 to MCBSTM32C COM1 and open "COM1" and "COMx".
  Data from "COM1" will be echoed on "COMx" and visa versa. 
  So, this is bi-directional communication between the physical COM 
  port 1 on MCBSTM32C and the Virtual COM Port COMx on host PC.
