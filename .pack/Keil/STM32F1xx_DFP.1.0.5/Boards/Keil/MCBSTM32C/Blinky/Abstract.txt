The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F107VC'
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32C' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F103 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)
                    
  STM32F103 RAM:    configured for on-chip RAM
                    (used for target debugging)
