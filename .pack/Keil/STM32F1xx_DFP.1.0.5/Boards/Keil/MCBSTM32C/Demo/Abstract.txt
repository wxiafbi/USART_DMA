The 'Demo' project is a demo program for the STM32F107VC microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32C' Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex
Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    =           72.00 MHz
  
   - Graphical Display shows:
     - 12-bit AD converter value bargraph depending on potentiometer position
     - State of buttons
     - Joystick directions
     - Touchscreen dependent images


The Demo program is available for two targets:

  STM32F107 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F107 MDK-Lite: same as 'STM32F107 Flash' but the bitmap-button
                      is exchanged with a text-button to meet the code 
                      size limit of MDK-Lite (32K)
